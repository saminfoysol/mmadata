				<h1> about </h1>
				<p>If you've ever wanted to try a martial art but was never sure which would actually be most effective perhaps the best person to ask would be a professional fighter. To determine which disciplines are most effective, we observed the backgrounds of current UFC champions and top 5 ranked fighters from every weight division. We only counted backgrounds where the fighter has high level experience. For example, for Jiu Jitsu this means a brown belt or higher, for wrestling, at least a top ranked state competitor in high school etc. </p>

    			<div class = "desc"> <p> Although from the bar graph above one might conclude jiu jitsu must be the ultimate martial art to go with above all else, most finishes in a UFC fight are actually by knockout or technical knockout by strikes, which makes sense since all fights start on the fight and therefore often with striking. The optimal martial art to learn for self defense may even vary by body type. An analysis of finishes in the UFC reveals the higher the weight class, the higher the chance of a knockout and the lower the chance of a submission victory.</p> </div>
